# In a magical forest 

In a magical forest, a young explorer named Alex embarked on a daring adventure. Armed with his faithful companion, a dog named Max, he ventured into the depths of the dense forest. Their steps led them to an old abandoned castle, shrouded in mysteries and legends.. As they were walking, they started chanting a weird song going like this:

```
In the digital night, guardians keep watch,  
Warding off shadows with cryptographic touch.  
In the binary world, they stand firm, ever bright.
```

The song echoed through the forest, and suddenly, the castle's doors creaked open. Alex and Max exchanged a puzzled glance, then cautiously stepped inside. The castle was dark and eerie, but they were determined to uncover its secrets. As they ventured deeper, they stumbled upon a room filled with ancient books and scrolls. One of the scrolls caught Alex's eye, and as he unrolled it, he discovered a hidden message. It read:

```
Dark Knights of the Digital Realm,
Seek the truth in the encrypted seal.
Beware the binary world's deceit,
For only the worthy shall defeat.
```
