- Type of Challenge: Forencics
- Duration: 2 days
- Challenge type : Solo

## Objective

Basics of using DeepBlueCLI for Windows log analysis and to perform basic forensic investigations.


## Tasks

1. Read about DeepBlueCLI and its capabilities in Windows log analysis. Understand its role in cybersecurity and digital forensics. Use this [repository](https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI) and [Video1](https://youtu.be/G8XjSO_eshc?feature=shared), [Video2](https://youtu.be/eWD17_E-hrE?feature=shared)

- Install DeepBlueCLI on a Windows virtual machine (VM).
Ensure you have PowerShell 5.1 or later installed.

- Obtain sample Windows Event Logs for analysis. You can use sample logs provided in the DeepBlueCLI repository or generate your own by simulating some activities on your Windows VM.

- Familiarize yourself with basic DeepBlueCLI commands.

- Explore the different types of logs DeepBlueCLI can analyze.

- Identify key features of the output provided by DeepBlueCLI, such as detecting suspicious activities, failed logins, and abnormal process creations.

- Analyze the provided sample event logs using DeepBlueCLI. Focus on the following types of logs:
Security Logs,System Logs, Application Logs.


## Reporting

1. Based on your analysis, prepare a brief report summarizing your findings. The report should include:
- Details the log analysis performed.
- A summary of the key findings from each type of log.
- Examples of suspicious activities detected.


2. Points to Consider:
- How can DeepBlueCLI be used in a real-world forensic investigation?
- What are the limitations of using DeepBlueCLI?
- What types of suspicious activities can you identify?
- Are there any failed login attempts or unusual process creations?
- Can you identify any patterns that might indicate a security incident?

3. Submission Instructions:
- Ensure your report includes screenshots and detailed explanations of your findings.
- Create an issue list based on the challenges that you have faced and if you could overcome them.
