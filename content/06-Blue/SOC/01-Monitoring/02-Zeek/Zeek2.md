## Zeek

Challenge Type - **Team**

### Tasks

1. Traffic Generation:Simulate different types of network traffic between the host and the VM. This can include:

- Browsing websites (HTTP/HTTPS traffic)
- Performing DNS queries
- Using SSH for remote connections

2. Simulate Malicious Activities:Introduce some benign and malicious activities for Zeek to detect:
- Run a simple port scan from the host to the VM using **nmap**
- Generate a suspicious HTTP request (e.g., accessing an HTTP only URL). 

3. Log Analysis: Analyze the logs generated by Zeek. Focus on the following log files:
- conn.log for connection summaries
- http.log for HTTP transactions
- dns.log for DNS queries
- ssl.log for SSL/TLS sessions
- weird.log for unusual activity

4. Generate Reports:Create a detailed report summarizing your findings. The report should include:
- Types of traffic generated and methods used
- Suspicious activities detected and their analysis
- Screenshots of relevant log entries

5. Presentation: Prepare a short presentation (5 slides) summarizing the key points of your report.
