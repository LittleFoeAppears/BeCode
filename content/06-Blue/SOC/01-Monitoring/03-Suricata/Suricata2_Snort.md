## Suricata vs Snort

### Tasks


1. Setup and Basic Configuration

- Install Snort on a separate virtual machine.
- Configure Snort configuration file (snort.conf).
- Set up network interfaces for live traffic capture.
- Configure logging and output options for  Snort.

2. Testing and Verification:
- Start Snort in live mode and verify that it is capturing traffic.
- Generate test traffic using tools like ping, nmap, or other network utilities.

3. Rule Creation and Customization
- Review the rule syntax and structure for Snort.
- Develop a set of custom rules that detect specific network behaviors or threats (e.g., SQL injection attempts, malware traffic patterns).
- Test each rule by generating/downloading appropriate test traffic to ensure they trigger correctly in both Suricata and Snort.

4. Rule Optimization (Optional)
- Optimize the custom rules to reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy.

5. Deliverables

- Screenshots or text files showing the configuration of  Snort.
- Logs demonstrating both Suricata and Snort successfully capturing and logging test traffic.
- A brief comparison report highlighting differences in configuration and initial observations.
- A comparison report on the effectiveness and performance of custom rules between Suricata and Snort
-A brief report on the process of optimization and any challenges encountered (optional).
